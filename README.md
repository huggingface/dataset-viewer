## Ask for a new feature 🎁

The dataset viewer pre-processes the [Hugging Face Hub datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) to make them ready to use in your apps using the API: list of the splits, first rows.

We plan to [add more features](https://github.com/huggingface/dataset-viewer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feature+request%22) to the server. Please comment there and upvote your favorite requests.
