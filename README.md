# Dataset viewer

The dataset page includes a table with the dataset's contents, arranged by pages of 100 rows. You can navigate between pages using the buttons at the bottom of the table, filter, search, look at basic statistics, and more.

This repository is the backend that provides the dataset viewer with pre-computed data through an API, for all the datasets on the Hub. The frontend viewer component is not part of this repository and is not open-source, as the rest of the Hub.
