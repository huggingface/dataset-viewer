# Setup your API client

## Get your API Token

To get started you need to:

- [Register](https://huggingface.co/join) or [Login](https://huggingface.co/login).
- Get your API token [in your Hugging Face profile](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

You should see a token `hf_xxxxx`.

If you do not submit your API token when sending requests to the API, you will not be able to access [gated datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-gated), such as [Common Voice](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_10_0), [OSCAR](oscar-corpus/OSCAR-2109) or [ImageNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k).
