# Splits

A dataset generally contains multiple [splits](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub#splits):

> a split is a specific subset of a dataset like `train` and `test`

and optionally various [configurations](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub#configurations):

> Some datasets contain several sub-datasets. For example, the MInDS-14 dataset has several sub-datasets, each one containing audio data in a different language. These sub-datasets are known as configurations.

See the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets) of the [ðŸ¤— datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library to read more in depth about the concepts.

To get the list of splits and configurations of a dataset:

  ```
  https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/splits?dataset={dataset_name}
  ```

<Tip warning={true}>
  Currently, the API only returns rows of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream">"streamable" datasets</a>. By loading the datasets in streaming mode, the first rows can be extracted without the need to download the whole dataset. In the future, we plan to also support non-streamable datasets.

For example, [`duorc`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/duorc) has six splits, within two configurations: https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/splits?dataset=duorc
