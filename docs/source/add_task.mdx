# Add a new task

The datasets server runs long-lasting tasks and stores the result to later serve it quickly through a REST API. For now, two tasks have been implemented:

- get the list the configurations and splits, and
- get the list of columns and first 100 rows.

The [datasets server project](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets-server) is open source and the next tasks to be implemented are listed in the issues with the tag [`new task`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+task%22). Among them:

- create and upload a parquet file on the Hub for a dataset,
- provide random access to the rows,
- provide statistics of a column,
- provide a list of similar datasets (proximity).
