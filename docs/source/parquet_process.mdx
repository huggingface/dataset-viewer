# Overview

Datasets Server automatically converts and publishes public datasets less than 5GB on the Hub as Parquet files. [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) files are column-based and they shine when you're working with big data. There are several different libraries you can use to work with the published Parquet files:

- [Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/), a Rust based DataFrame library
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), a data analysis tool for working with data structures
- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/), a high-performance SQL database for analytical queries
