# Dataset Viewer API Playground

The [API Playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cfahlgren1/datasets-api-playground) is a space that allows you to make requests to the Dataset Viewer API and visualize the results in real-time. It's a great way to explore the capabilities of the API and test different queries.
