# Datasets server

The ðŸ¤— Datasets server gives access to the contents, metadata and basic statistics of the [Hugging Face Hub datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) via a REST API.

## History

The API has originally been developed to provide data to the [Dataset viewer](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-viewer) on the Hub. Indeed, the information about the datasets cannot be extracted live, and must be preprocessed and stored beforehand in order to later be accessed quickly on the Hub.

We decided to make the API public to give access programmatically, through a REST API, to the contents, metadata and statistics of the Hub datasets.

## Evolution

The API currently provides three endpoints.

The plan is to add more of them in the near future. The two next features should be the basic statistics by column, and random access to the datasets rows.
