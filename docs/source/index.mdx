# Datasets server

Integrate into your apps over 10,000 [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) via simple HTTP requests, with pre-processed responses and scalability built-in.

The datasets server runs long-lasting tasks and stores the result to later serve it quickly through a REST API:

> It processes the datasets ⚙️ / you consume the API 🍹
