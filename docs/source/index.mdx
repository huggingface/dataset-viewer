# ü§ó Datasets Server

Datasets Server is a lightweight web API for visualizing and exploring all types of datasets - computer vision, speech, text, and tabular - stored on the Hugging Face [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).
As datasets increase in size and data type richness, the cost of preprocessing (storage and compute) these datasets can be challenging and time-consuming.
To help users access these modern datasets, Datasets Server runs a server behind the scenes to generate the API responses ahead of time and stores them in a database so they are instantly returned when you make a query through the API.

Let Datasets Server take care of the heavy lifting so you can use a simple **REST API** on any of the **30,000+ datasets on Hugging Face** to:

- List the **dataset splits, column names and data types**
- Get the **dataset size** (in number of rows or bytes)
- Download and view **rows at any index** in the dataset
- **Search** a word in the dataset
- Get insightful **statistics** about the data
- Access the dataset as **parquet files** to use in your favorite **processing or analytics framework**
