# Datasets server

The ðŸ¤— Datasets server gives access to the contents, metadata and basic statistics of the [Hugging Face Hub datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) via a REST API.

Try it with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/huggingface/workspace/hugging-face-apis/documentation/23242779-d068584e-96d1-4d92-a703-7cb12cbd8053).

## History

The API has originally been developed to provide data to the [Dataset viewer](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-viewer) on the Hub. Because of the large volume of data, the information about the datasets cannot be extracted on-the-fly, and must be preprocessed and stored beforehand in order to later be accessed quickly on the Hub.

We decided to make the API public to provide programmatic access to the information about datasets.
