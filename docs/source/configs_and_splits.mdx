# Configurations and splits

The datasets aimed at training and evaluating a Machine Learning model are generally divided into multiple _[splits](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub#splits)_, for example `train`, `test` and `validation`.

Some datasets also use _[configurations](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub#configurations)_ (sub-datasets) to group similar examples: [CommonVoice](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_10_0)'s configurations embed the audio recordings of each language ; [GLUE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) provides one configuration for every evaluation task.
