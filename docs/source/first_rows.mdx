# Preview a dataset

Datasets Server provides a `/first-rows` endpoint for visualizing the first 100 rows of a dataset. This'll give you a good idea of the data types and example data contained in a dataset.

![dataset-viewer](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/dataset-viewer.png)

<Tip warning={true}>
  Currently, only {" "}
  <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream">streamable</a> datasets
  are supported so Datasets Server can extract the first 100 rows without downloading the
  whole dataset. This is especially useful for large datasets where downloading
  an entire dataset may take hours!
</Tip>

This guide shows you how to use Datasets Server's `/first-rows` endpoint to preview a dataset. Feel free to also try it out with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/huggingface/workspace/hugging-face-apis/request/23242779-32d6a8be-b800-446a-8cee-f6b5ca1710df), [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hugging-face-hugging-face-default/api/hugging-face-datasets-api), or [ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/openapi.json#operation/listFirstRows).

The `/first-rows` endpoint accepts three query parameters:

- `dataset`: the dataset name, for example `glue` or `mozilla-foundation/common_voice_10_0`
- `config`: the configuration name, for example `cola`
- `split`: the split name, for example `train`

<python>
```python
import requests
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}
API_URL = "https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train"
def query():
    response = requests.get(API_URL, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
data = query()
```
</python>
<js>
```js
import fetch from "node-fetch";
async function query(data) {
    const response = await fetch(
        "https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train",
        {
            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}` },
            method: "GET"
        }
    );
    const result = await response.json();
    return result;
}
query().then((response) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
});
```
</js>
<curl>
```curl
curl https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
```
</curl>
</inferencesnippet>

The endpoint response is a JSON containing two keys:

- The [`features`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_dataset_features) of a dataset, including the column's name and data type.
- The first 100 `rows` of a dataset and the content contained in each column of a specific row.

For example, here are the `features` and the first 100 `rows` of the `duorc`/`SelfRC` train split:

```json

  "dataset": "duorc",
  "config": "SelfRC",
  "split": "train",

## Truncated responses

For some datasets, the response size from `/first-rows` may exceed 1MB, in which case the response is truncated until the size is under 1MB. This means you may not get 100 rows in your response because the rows are truncated.

In some cases, if even the first few rows generate a response that exceeds 1MB, some of the columns are truncated and converted to a string. You'll see these listed in the `truncated_cells` field.

For example, the [`ett`](https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=ett&config=m2&split=test) dataset only returns 10 rows, and the `target` and `feat_dynamic_real` columns are truncated:

```json

    {
      "row_idx": 0,
      "row": {

        "target": "[38.6619987487793,38.222999572753906,37.34400177001953,37.124000549316406,37.124000549316406,36.9039",
