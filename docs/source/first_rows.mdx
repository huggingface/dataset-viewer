# First rows

The endpoint `/first-rows` provides the columns and the first rows of a dataset [split](./splits):

  ```
  https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset={dataset_name}&config={config_name}&split={split_name}
  ```

The first 100 rows, or all the rows if the split contains less than 100 rows, are returned. The list of columns (called [features](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_dataset_features) to stick with the `datasets` library) contain the data type.

<Tip warning={true}>
 Currently, the API only returns rows of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream">"streamable" datasets</a>. By loading a dataset in streaming mode, the first rows can be extracted without downloading the whole dataset.
</Tip>

For example, here are the features and the first rows of the `duorc` / `SelfRC` train split.

## Truncated responses

When the response size for 100 rows is too big, the last rows are removed until the response size is under 1MB.

If even the first rows generate a response that does not fit within the limit, the content of the cells themselves is truncated and converted to a string. In this case, the truncated cells are listed in the `truncated_cells` field.

See for example the [`ett`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ett/viewer/m2/test) dataset: only 10 rows are returned, and the content of two of the columns are truncated.
