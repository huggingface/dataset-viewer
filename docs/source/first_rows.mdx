# First rows

The endpoint `/first-rows` provides the columns and the first rows of a dataset [split](./splits).

```
https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset={dataset}&config={config}&split={split}
```

The endpoint takes three query parameters:

| Query parameters       |                                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dataset** (required) | the dataset name, for example `glue` or `mozilla-foundation/common_voice_10_0` |
| **config** (required)  | the configuration name, for example `cola`                                     |
| **split** (required)   | the split name, for example `train`                                            |

Pass your API token if you query a [gated dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-gated).

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}
API_URL = "https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train"
def query():
    response = requests.request("GET", API_URL, headers=headers)
    return json.loads(response.content.decode("utf-8"))
data = query()
```
</python>
<js>
```js

async function query(data) {
    const response = await fetch(
        "https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train",
        {
            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}` },
            method: "GET"
        }
    );
    const result = await response.json();
    return result;
}
query().then((response) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
});
```
</js>
<curl>
```curl
curl https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
```
</curl>
</inferencesnippet>

The response is a JSON. The first 100 rows, or all the rows if the split contains less than 100 rows, are returned under the `rows` key. The list of columns (called [features](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_dataset_features) to stick with the `datasets` library) contain the data type and are returned under the `features` key. The `dataset`, `config` and `split` fields are also provided in the response.

| Response     |                        |
| :----------- | :--------------------- |
| **dataset**  | the dataset name       |
| **config**   | the configuration name |
| **split**    | the split name         |
| **features** | the list of features   |
| **rows**     | the list of rows       |

The detail of every feature is:

| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **feature_idx**          | the index of the column                                                                                               |

| **type**                 | the [feature type](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_dataset_features) as defined by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library |

| Response: row fields |                                                                               |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **row_idx**          | the index of the row                                                          |
| **row**              | the content of the row, with one field for each column                        |
| **truncated_cells**  | the list of truncated cells. See [Truncated responses](#truncated-responses). |

For example, here are the features and the first rows of the `duorc` / `SelfRC` train split.

## Truncated responses

When the response size for 100 rows is too big, the last rows are removed until the response size is under 1MB.

If even the first rows generate a response that does not fit within the limit, the content of the cells themselves is truncated and converted to a string. In this case, the truncated cells are listed in the `truncated_cells` field.

See for example the [`ett`](https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/first-rows?dataset=ett&config=m2&split=test) dataset: only 10 rows are returned, and the content of two of the columns are truncated.
