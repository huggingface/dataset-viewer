# First rows

The endpoint `/rows` provides the columns and the first rows of a dataset [split](./splits):

  ```
  https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/rows?dataset={dataset_name}&config={config_name}&split={split_name}
  ```

The first 100 rows, or all the rows if the split contains less than 100 rows, are returned. The list of columns contain the data type.

For example, the columns and the first rows of the `duorc` / `SelfRC` train split are: https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/rows?dataset=duorc&config=SelfRC&split=train

## Truncated responses

When the size of the response for 100 rows would have been too big, the last rows are removed until reaching under the acceptable limit.

If even the first rows generate a response that does not fit within the limit, the content of the cells themselves is truncated and converted to a string. In this case, the truncated cells are listed in the `truncated_cells` field.

See for example the [`ett`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ett/viewer/m2/test) dataset: https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/rows?dataset=ett&config=m2&split=test. Only 10 rows are returned, and the content of two of the columns are truncated:

```json
  ...

      },
      "truncated_cells": ["target", "feat_dynamic_real"]
    }
  ...
```

This limitation was introduced to ensure the response size is always under 1 MB.
